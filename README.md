# codon.js
A lightweight JavaScript library for generating and analyzing genomic data.

This is still very much a work in progress.
I imagine there are already other utilities which accomplish similar tasks, but I'm really putting this together to get some practice with bioinformatics, making libraries, generating documentation, etc...

Still, I'm definitely interested to hear suggestions for additional features.
